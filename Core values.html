    <h2>OUR CORE VALUES</h2>

    <p><strong>We are Evangelical:</strong> By being evangelical, TAFES is a Bible-believing Fellowship. The Bible is our standard & final authority in all matters of faith & conduct.</p>

    <p><strong>We are Interdenominational and Nondenominational:</strong> By being interdenominational, TAFES membership cuts across various denominations and hence provides a common forum for worship. All members subscribe to TAFES doctrinal basis of faith. As a nondenominational Fellowship, TAFES is not a denomination and does not align with any particular denomination. However, TAFES recognizes and identifies with local churches and serves them by reaching out to students while they are on campus.</p>

    <p><strong>We are student-centred:</strong> We operate primarily in tertiary institutions and we are committed to students’ initiative and leadership based on biblical principles.</p>

    <p><strong>We are passionate about the unity of believers:</strong> As a result of our interdenominational and nondenominational status, we provide a forum where believers from different denominations interact and relate as members of the universal Church – the body of Christ.</p>

    <p><strong>We advocate the practices of excellence and integrity:</strong> We aim to ensure that our students are academically excellent and that they have godly character with Christ as their role model. Through this virtue, these students become associates who will honour God through their lifestyles in the broader society.</p>
