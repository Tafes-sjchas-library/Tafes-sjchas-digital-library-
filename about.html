    <h1>ABOUT TAFES </h1>

    <p><strong>In 1973</strong> the national movement in Uganda (FOCUS Uganda) was registered.</p>
    <p>Before its registration, the national movement in Tanzania (FOCUS Tanzania) operated under the Scripture Union of Tanzania until 1990 when it was registered as <strong>Tanzania Fellowship of Evangelical Students (TAFES)</strong>.</p>
    <p>To date, TAFES is still affiliated to the <strong>International Fellowship of Evangelical Students (IFES)</strong> together with other student movements in more than 170 countries worldwide.</p>
    <p><strong>TAFES Headquarters</strong> is located at Plot 725 Boko, Off Ununio Road Dar es Salaam at our Student Center, in the United Republic of Tanzania.</p>

      <h2>The Doctrinal Basis of Faith</h2>
      <p>TAFES has a doctrinal basis of faith which is the fundamental truth of Christianity:</p>

        <li>The unity of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit in the Godhead.</li>
        <li>The sovereignty of God in creation, revelation, redemption and final judgment.</li>
        <li>The divine inspiration and trustworthiness of the Holy Scriptures and its supreme authority.</li>
        <li>The universal sinfulness and guilt of all men since the fall.</li>
        <li>Redemption solely through the sacrificial death of the Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
        <li>The bodily resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ.</li>
        <li>The presence and power of the Holy Spirit in regeneration.</li>
        <li>Justification by grace through faith alone.</li>
        <li>The indwelling and work of the Holy Spirit in the believer.</li>
        <li>The one Holy Universal Church, the Body of Christ.</li>
        <li>The expectation of the personal return of Jesus Christ.</li>
        <li>The unity of Believers in Christ.</li>
